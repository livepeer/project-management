# Livepeer Project Management Repository 
This repository is used for project management for various initiatives affecting the Livepeer protocol and clients. The main use of this repository is for the Development Coordination meetings ([more info on these meetings can be found here](/DevelopmentCoordinationCalls/README.md)). It is also used for Breakout Rooms on various technical topics, whose agendas can be found under the Issues page. [This Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/community_calendar%40livepeer.org/public/basic.ics) also tracks upcoming  meetings.

## Development Coordination Meetings Overview
Development Coordination is a bi-weekly meeting held by the Livepeer development community to discuss technical issues and coordinate work on the Livepeer protocol and clients. The meetings are attended by core contributors from various organizations. During the call, participants discuss ongoing workstreams, potential changes, testing and other related issues.

## Agendas
The agendas and meeting notes for calls are tracked in the Issues tab of this repository. To add an item to an agenda, simply add a comment to one of the agenda issues.

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Development Coordination meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussions. The [Livepeer Forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/) and Discord #governance channel are better venues for such discussions.

## Definitions

### Livepeer Core Developers
A core developer is responsible for contributing to the development and maintenance of the Livepeer network, including implementing updates, new capabilities, and optimizations. The team works on core software, such as Livepeer clients or protocol explorers, and plays a key role in planning and execution.

### Current Criteria (subject to change)
- Core developers or teams must meet one or more of the following criteria:
- 1 or more dedicated team members working on public goods for Livepeer
- Treasury-funded SPE with track record of delivering software
- Unique knowledge / ability to advise other core developers

## Who Can Attend
Core developers are invited to attend the meetings as speakers; the entire Livepeer community is welcome to attend. Sometimes non-core contributors with particular expertise on a topic are invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to Hunter Hillman.

## Who Facilitates the Meetings
Today, Hunter Hillman facilitates the Development Coordination meeting. If there are Breakout Rooms, they are usually chaired by their respective expert / champion.

The meetings are independent of any organization. However, Hunter Hillman is a Product Manager for Livepeer Inc.
